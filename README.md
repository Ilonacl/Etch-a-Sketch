# Etch-a-Sketch

Creating the divs using JavaScript and flexbox.

Setting up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would.

Adding a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.

Implementing a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.
